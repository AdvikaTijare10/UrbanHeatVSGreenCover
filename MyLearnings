### üõ∞ Why We Used Two Different Satellites

In this project, we used:

- **Sentinel-2** for calculating **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**
- **Landsat-8** for calculating **LST (Land Surface Temperature)**

One satellite alone is usually **not enough** to provide all the necessary data:
- **Sentinel-2** does **not have thermal bands**, so it can't measure surface temperature.
- **Landsat-8** has thermal bands, but its spectral resolution in visible/NIR bands is lower than Sentinel-2, so it's less ideal for NDVI.

Hence, we used two satellites, each chosen for its **strength**:
- **Sentinel-2**: Better for vegetation analysis (NDVI)
- **Landsat-8**: Better for thermal analysis (LST)

Even though the data comes from different satellites, we can still use them together effectively by:
- Ensuring the **same AOI (Area of Interest)** is used
- Using images from the **same date range**
- Applying **cloud filtering** and **median composites** to get clean images

### üå°Ô∏è Relationship Between NDVI and LST

We observed that **NDVI and LST are inversely related**:
- Areas with **high NDVI** (dense vegetation) tend to have **lower temperatures**
- Areas with **low NDVI** (urban or bare land) often show **higher temperatures**

This relationship is crucial in understanding the **Urban Heat Island effect**, and shows how green cover helps reduce surface temperature.
